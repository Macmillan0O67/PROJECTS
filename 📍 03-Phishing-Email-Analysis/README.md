## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world **SOC Level 1 phishing email investigation**.  
The objective was to analyze a suspicious email, extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), classify the attack type, and map findings to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

This project demonstrates practical SOC triage methodology used in Security Operations Centers (SOC).

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform email header analysis
- Identify spoofed domains and sender anomalies
- Extract and investigate malicious URLs
- Classify phishing attack type
- Map findings to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Document findings in SOC report format

---

## 🔍 Investigation Process

### 1️⃣ Email Header Analysis
- Analyzed SPF and DKIM authentication results
- Identified authentication failures
- Reviewed "Received" headers for source tracing

### 2️⃣ Sender & Domain Investigation
- Traced originating IP address
- Checked domain registration details
- Verified domain reputation
- Identified spoofed/lookalike domains

### 3️⃣ URL Analysis
- Extracted embedded URLs
- Performed reputation analysis
- Checked redirection behavior
- Identified credential harvesting intent

### 4️⃣ Threat Classification
- Categorized phishing subtype
- Documented Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Assigned severity level
