# 1. Executive Summary

A vulnerability assessment was conducted on an intentionally vulnerable web application in a controlled lab environment. The objective of this engagement was to identify security weaknesses aligned with the OWASP Top 10 and evaluate their potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

The assessment identified three vulnerabilities:

- 1 High-Risk Vulnerability  
- 2 Medium-Risk Vulnerabilities  

Immediate remediation is recommended for the High severity finding to prevent potential database compromise.

# 2. Scope of Assessment

## 2.1 Target
- Web Application (Lab Environment Only)

## 2.2 Testing Methodology
- Black-box testing  
- Manual exploitation  
- Automated vulnerability scanning  
- Risk validation and classification  

## 2.3 Tools Used
- Burp Suite  
- OpenVAS  
- Browser Developer Tools  
- Manual payload testing  

---

# 3. Risk Rating Methodology

Risk levels were determined based on:

- Exploitability  
- Impact on Confidentiality  
- Impact on Integrity  
- Impact on Availability  

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Description |
|----------|------------|
| High     | Immediate risk requiring urgent remediation |
| Medium   | Moderate risk requiring planned remediation |
| Low      | Minor risk requiring monitoring |

# 4. Summary of Findings

| ID    | Vulnerability              | Severity | Risk Impact              |
|-------|----------------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| VA-01 | SQL Injection              | High     | Database Compromise      |
| VA-02 | Reflected XSS              | Medium   | Session Hijacking        |
| VA-03 | Security Misconfiguration  | Medium   | Information Disclosure   |

# 5. Detailed Findings

---

## 5.1 VA-01: SQL Injection

**Severity:** High  
**Risk Level:** Critical to Business Data  

### Description
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing SQL commands to be injected into backend database queries.

### Affected Component
Login input field parameter: `username`

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

```sql
' OR '1'='1' --
```

The payload successfully bypassed authentication controls.

### Impact
- Unauthorized access to database  
- Data exfiltration  
- Data modification or deletion  
- Full application compromise  

### Recommendation
- Implement parameterized queries (Prepared Statements)  
- Apply input validation and sanitization  
- Use ORM frameworks  
- Deploy Web Application Firewall (WAF)  

---

## 5.2 VA-02: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Severity:** Medium  

### Description
The application reflects unsanitized user input in HTTP responses, enabling script execution in the victim’s browser.

### Affected Endpoint
Search parameter: `query=`

### Proof of Concept

```html
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

JavaScript executed successfully in browser context.

### Impact
- Session hijacking  
- Credential theft  
- Phishing attacks  
- User impersonation  

### Recommendation
- Implement proper output encoding  
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP)  
- Validate and sanitize user input  

---

## 5.3 VA-03: Security Misconfiguration

**Severity:** Medium  

### Description
The server was found exposing unnecessary debugging information and verbose server headers.

### Observed Issues
- Server version disclosure  
- Debug mode enabled  
- Directory listing enabled  

### Impact
- Information disclosure  
- Increased attack surface  
- Easier reconnaissance for attackers  

### Recommendation
- Disable directory listing  
- Remove verbose server banners  
- Harden server configuration  
- Follow secure deployment checklist

# 6. OWASP Top 10 Mapping

| Vulnerability              | OWASP Category              |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| SQL Injection              | Injection                   |
| Reflected XSS              | Cross-Site Scripting        |
| Security Misconfiguration  | Security Misconfiguration   |

---

# 7. Conclusion

The assessment revealed critical input validation weaknesses that could allow attackers to compromise sensitive data. The SQL Injection vulnerability poses the highest risk and should be remediated immediately.

Implementing secure coding practices, proper input validation, and security hardening measures will significantly reduce the application's attack surface.
